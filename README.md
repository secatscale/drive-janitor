# üöó drive-janitor

A simple tool to help you detect and delete files on your disk based on their extension, age, or name ‚Äî even those in the trash.

Run on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

## Features

- üßπ Detect and delete unwanted files by extension (MIME type), age (Ctime), or name (with regex support)
- üóëÔ∏è Clean files even from the trash
- üîí Safe: dry-run mode to preview changes
- ‚ö° Fast and easy to use, with a simple YAML configuration

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
	git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drive-janitor.git
	cd drive-janitor
```

Need pkg-config :

```
	vcpkg install yara
	apt-get install libyara-dev yara pkg-config
	brew install pkg-config yara
```

## Usage

1. Configure your settings in `config.yaml`.
2. Run the janitor:

```bash
go run drive-janitor -config config.yaml
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to specify:

- **Detections**:  
    Define which files to match in the `detections` section. Each detection uses a unique rule `name`, a `mimetype` (e.g., `"image/png"`), and optionally a `max_age` (in days) to filter files by age. Setting `max_age` to `-1` disables age filtering.

- **Recursions**:  
    Specify which directories to scan in the `recursions` section. Each recursion includes a rule `name`, a start `path` (e.g., `"./samples"`), a `max_depth` for how deep to scan, and an optional `path_to_ignore` list to exclude subdirectories.

- **Logs**:  
    Configure where logs are stored in the `logs` section by setting a rule `name`, a `log_format` (text, json or csv) and a `log_repository` path (e.g., `"./var/.log"`).

- **Actions**:  
    Define what happens to matched files in the `actions` section. Each action has a rule `name`, a `delete` flag (e.g., `false` to only log), and a `log` reference.

- **Rules**:  
    Connect detections, recursions, and actions in the `rules` section. Each rule specifies which detections, recursion, and action to use for processing files.

‚ö° All paths in the configuration supports `$trash`, `$download` ou `$home` 

Example:
```yaml
name: TestMain
version: 1.0.0

detections:
    - name: "detection1"
        mimetype: "image/png"
        max_age: 5

    - name: "detection2"
        mimetype: "application/pdf"

    - name: "detection3"
        mimetype: "video/mp4"

recursions:
    - name: "recursion1"
        path: "./samples"
        max_depth: 4
        path_to_ignore: ["./samples/ignore"]

logs:
    - name: "logging1"
        log_repository: "./var/.log"

actions:
    - name: "action1"
        delete: false 
        log: "logging1"

rules:
    - name: "FINALRULE1"
        action: "action1"
        detection: ["detection1", "detection2", "detection3"]
        recursion: "recursion1"
```
